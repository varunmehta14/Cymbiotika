data: {"status": "complete", "answer": "The provided text describes an oatmeal recipe, not a sandwich recipe.  Therefore, I cannot directly answer your question about sandwich ingredients. However, I can offer a creative recipe for a savory oatmeal sandwich inspired by the oatmeal recipe's ingredients.  This savory oatmeal sandwich recipe is entirely original and not derived from the source texts.\n\n**Savory Oatmeal Sandwich Recipe (Original Creation)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (for a heartier texture)\n* 1 cup vegetable broth (or less, see instructions; for a savory flavor)\n* 1/2 cup finely chopped apple (adds sweetness and texture)\n* 1/4 cup finely chopped onion (adds savory depth)\n* 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (adds cheesy flavor and B vitamins)\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 2 slices hearty whole-wheat bread (sourdough or a similar sturdy bread is recommended)\n* Optional additions: 1/4 cup cooked mushrooms, 1/4 cup cooked crumbled bacon or sausage (for extra protein and flavor), 1 fried egg, 1 slice of cheddar cheese.\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Oatmeal:** Combine oats, vegetable broth, apple, onion, nutritional yeast, thyme, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan.  Start with 1 cup of broth, but be prepared to add less if the oats seem too wet during cooking.  Old-fashioned oats absorb more liquid than quick-cooking oats.\n2. **Cook the Oatmeal:** Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 7-10 minutes, or until oats are cooked through and the liquid is mostly absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. The oatmeal should be thick but not dry; adjust the amount of broth as needed to achieve your desired consistency.\n3. **Assemble the Sandwich:** Spread the cooked oatmeal evenly on both slices of hearty whole-wheat bread. Add the cooked mushrooms (if using), crumbled bacon or sausage (if using), fried egg (if using), and cheese (if using).\n4. **Serve:** Enjoy your savory oatmeal sandwich warm or at room temperature.\n\n\n**Nutritional Enhancements and Variations:**\n\n* **Protein Boost:** Add 1-2 scoops of protein powder to the oatmeal while cooking for an extra protein kick.\n* **Vegetable Variety:** Experiment with other finely chopped vegetables like carrots, zucchini, or spinach.\n* **Spice it Up:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a touch of heat.\n* **Herb Infusion:** Experiment with different herbs like rosemary, sage, or parsley.\n\n\nThis savory oatmeal sandwich offers a unique and nutritious meal option.  While a precise nutritional analysis requires specific ingredient quantities and brands, it's likely to be higher in protein and fiber than a typical sandwich, thanks to the oats and optional additions. Remember to adjust seasonings to your taste preferences.", "sources": [{"document_id": "823e9521-9219-42ca-8f1c-afc2499840ae", "source": "cookbook-pages-5.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "title": "cookbook-pages-5.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "pages": 1}, {"document_id": "823e9521-9219-42ca-8f1c-afc2499840ae", "chunk_index": 1, "pages": 1, "title": "cookbook-pages-5.pdf", "source": "cookbook-pages-5.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf"}]}
